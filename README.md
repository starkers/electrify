Try this on an empty VM and tell me how you progress please..

I've not run the script in its entirety yet and I'm sure there are plenty of fcplms, tell me.
Even if you just want to copy/paste it'll save you some time deploying.

TODO:
- flesh out a way to just run this as root
- allow for the "bitcoin" username and electrum unix users to be set as variables
- test other ubuntu's
- create an init script
- add a function to secure the firewall ports?
- dunno
